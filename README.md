## "Language: PHP & MySQL DB"

---

## Learning objectives :computer:

- Create a database
- Connect a PHP application to a database
- Store data in a database
- Make queries safely

This is the repository for the exercise: https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-yu-3-21/tree/master/3.The-Mountain/6.About-databases

## The Mission

We've touched the basics of PHP, and now it's time to learn about its partner in crime, let's look at MySQL/MariaDB and what it does / how it works.

## Guestbook, but MySQL

The guestbook you built saves data in a file. Technically, that's already a database. But storing and retrieving data from a file is dangerous and slow. Using a real database for the purpose is a much better idea.
The goal of this exercise is to substitute the method you use to store data from a file to a database.
